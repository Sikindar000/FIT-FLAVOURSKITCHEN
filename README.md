<h1>Problem Statement:</h1>
<p>Today’s restaurant faces challenges ranging from the use of processed ingredients to a lack of emphasis on organic and locally sourced produce. The menu lacks freshness and nutritional diversity, leading to concerns about the overall health impact on customers.

Limited transparency about ingredient sources and preparation methods further erodes customer trust.

This restaurant struggles to adapt to evolving consumer preferences for organic, sustainable, and locally produced foods, risking its relevance in a health-conscious market."</p>
